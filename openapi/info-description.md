This is an **example** API to demonstrate features of the OpenAPI specification.

# Introduction

Ren this API definition is intended to to be a good starting point for
describing your API in 

[OpenAPI/Swagger
format](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.2.md).

It also demonstrates features of the
[create-openapi-repo](https://github.com/Redocly/create-openapi-repo) tool
and 

the [Redoc](https://github.com/Redocly/Redoc) documentation engine. Beyond
the standard OpenAPI syntax, we use a few 

[vendor
extensions](https://github.com/Redocly/Redoc/blob/master/docs/redoc-vendor-extensions.md).
